# ABI to Warp Converter

A powerful tool for converting MultiversX smart contract ABIs into [vLEAP Warps](https://docs.vleap.xyz/warps/overview), enabling easy integration of your smart contracts with the vLEAP ecosystem.

## Overview

The ABI to Warp converter allows developers to seamlessly transform their MultiversX smart contract ABIs into interactive vLEAP Warps. This enables your smart contracts to be easily accessed and interacted with through the vLEAP platform, providing a user-friendly interface for end users.

## Features

- **ABI Parsing**: Upload and parse MultiversX smart contract ABIs
- **Selective Conversion**: Choose specific endpoints to include in your Warp
- **AI-Powered Metadata Generation**: Automatically generate descriptive metadata for your Warp using OpenAI
- **One-Click Publishing**: Publish your ABI and Warp with simple button clicks

## Usage Guide

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Use the MultiversX wallet connector to authenticate
2. **Upload ABI**: Paste your smart contract ABI JSON and specify the contract address
3. **Select Functions**: Choose which contract endpoints to include in the Warp
4. **Generate Metadata**: Use the OpenAI integration to generate descriptive metadata or create it manually
5. **Preview Warp**: Review the generated Warp definition
6. **Publish**: Publish your ABI and Warp to the vLEAP platform
7. **Share**: Share your Warp URL with users to allow them to interact with your contract
